- should keywords be a set data structure instead of a list
- I should protect against buffs being given to the wrong minions
- Raw modifying minions at buffs[n] index in my state.board is likely to cause array out of bounds errors and I should check for that
- Token summon battlecries are broken
- logic in add card should look like:
    1) non token battlecries for a minion
    2) add minion
    3) token battlecries for the minion
    4) see if hooks were triggered
    - this is because if we summon the minion before we do non token battlecries, things like metaltooth leaper will buff themselves
    - also if we do all battlecries at once and don't distinguish between token battlecries and non-token battlecries, if there are 6 minions on board when we play a token battlecry
        that token will get onto the board and prevent the original minion from being played
    - playing the minion must happen before hooks are triggered because floating watcher buffs itself if there is a wrath weaver
- inHand should probably get changed to onboard
- somehow I have to deal with the scenario of playing the following minions from hand (in rafaam's case) currently the api isn't able to pull them up:
    - murloc scout
    - tabbycat
    - curator's amalgam
- implement all the hooks
